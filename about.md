# Hi there! &#128075;
<p>
My name is Oscar Thelander, working as a Quantitative Analyst in Stockholm, Sweden.
</p>

<p>
I have broad interests within data science and programming and find many aspects fascinating, e.g. economics, sports, financial markets... This is the basis for this blog.
</p>


## Other
In my spare time I enjoy reading about sports, business, statistics or whatever interesting book or article pops up. I am also hoping to be able to do a backyard ultra some day.
